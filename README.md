## Introduction
<em>5/30/2023</em>

Before I start with Optum this upcoming July, I wanted to make something to review and learn HTML, CSS and Spring Boot. Prior to this project, I never had the opportunity to really try out web development during my school years, since I vaguely followed given templates to implement web interfaces whenever needed. Although I never saw myself being interested in front end development, it's something that I've always wanted to try, and I should definitely have working knowledge on it. 

In addition to this, I made a goal for myself of solidifying my understanding of dependency injection and the MVC architecture since I most recently worked on a project that involved those two principles and Microservices in my senior capstone project. During that senior capstone project, I used the Micronaut framework in our backend, and after seeing how great it was, I wanted to explore the Spring ecosystem!


I started this project on 5/6/2023 and finally finished on 5/29/2023.<br>
This project took around <em>22 hours</em> over the span of 11 working days.

## Project Description
This is a full-stack web application developed using Java and the Spring Boot framework. 

The front end of this project serves as my web portfolio to showcase my basic contact info, links to GitHub and LinkedIn, projects I've worked on with basic descriptions, and includes a contact form to send me messages.
